# ML_Convolution
Here I am creating the architecture of a neural network. It is trained on a dataset with 3 clusters (boots, sandals, shoes). Then the loss curve and confusion matrix are built.
In the end, Iâ€™m trying to use this neural network to determine the class of 3 pictures that were not used in the dataset
